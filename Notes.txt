    Problem parsing Terms with no explicit coefficient. Ex: x^(23)
        x^(2) is not parsed as a single token [Fixed by starting i at 0, not 1]
    -2+8 is converted to +`2+8 [Fixed by adding check for i == 0 in formatInputExpression() (Expression.cpp)]
    (-2+8) * (6-(-1)) SIGABRTs [Fixed by adding check for i > 0 when parsing string b in formatInputExpression() (Expression.cpp)]
    (-2+8) Segfaults b/c it is formatted as (+`2+8) [Fixed by adding a check that charAt(i - 1) is not a '(' in formatInputExpression() (Expression.cpp)]

    End of day. Next steps are to run test cases and implement pow().

    12:27 -- Taking a break. Pick up working on Expression::addLikeTerms()
    17:31 -- Need to figure out how to make all operators after Expression::evaluate() to be '+' so that Expression::addLikeTerms() works correctly

    Expression::formatInputExpression() -- Automatically add '-' symbols to processed, then check end of processed to determine what to do with
                                            additional '-' symbols (i.e. replace two with '+', replace one with '`')
    Term::parseTerm() -- Fixed some bugs with parsing coefficients and variables
